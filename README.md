# DocuSign .NET Core Client

This is an exploratory implementation of the DocuSign API within a .NET Core compatible C# implementation.

This is a fork of the official [DocuSign C# API](https://github.com/docusign/docusign-csharp-client).
When the official repository properly supports .NET Core, it is recommended to use that repository
instead.
